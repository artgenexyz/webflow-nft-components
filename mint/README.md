## FAQ

### I'm confused / it's not working, can you help me?
Yes, absolutely! You can contact us at https://buildship.dev, or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/buildship-dev/webflow-nft-components/issues/new)

### How to add "Connect wallet" button?
Mint button will ask to connect wallet, so it's not necessary to add a "Connect wallet" button.

If you still want to do it, create a Webflow button with ID `connect`.

### How to add minted counter?
Just create two text elements and assign them:
- `minted-counter` ID to display minted number
- `total-counter` ID to display collection size

### How to use this with Polygon, Binance, or other Ethereum-based networks?
It's easy! Change `NETWORK_ID` in the code snippet:

- Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet: `NETWORK_ID = 4`
- Polygon `NETWORK_ID = 137`
- Binance `NETWORK_ID = 56`
- For others visit: https://chainlist.org/
